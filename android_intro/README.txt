I did the ColorMeProgrammatically first because I have experience with java not but android. I was stuck for a while because I thought my code was causing the app to fail but in reality the new project created in eclipse was never able to open in the first place. It would crash as soon as I tried to start it. After fiddling around with it for a few hours I abandoned Eclipse and tried Android Studio. I had much more success on Android Studio. The first thing I tried when making the project was running it and seeing if the hello world would show and it did. Most of the Button and Layout coding was familiar to me, but I was not sure how to space out the Buttons so that they strecthed across the screen. I eventually found a way to get the screen size and did some simple math with that, since I could not find another way to do it. The part that I was really confused on was how to not hard code the colors/strings into the code. I kept trying things R.id.red but it was not working. However, after I made the switch to android studio, a pop up showed up that suggested I use the getResources function first and from there I was able to make the app. I spent most of my time trying to figure out why my app was crashing when I was coding in Eclipse, but the process became much faster when I gave up on that and moved to Android Studio.

ColorMeXML was relatively simple since I used the layout editor that Android Studio provided. I thought I would be able to implement the app entirely through xml, which is what I thought we were suppose to do, but I soon realized I needed to code the implemenation in the java file. I was confused on how to get the layout from the xml file but by looking through the slides I saw that I needed to assign it an ID and use the findviewbyid function. Android studio did make an apk file but it did not put it in a bin folder like eclipse so I manually moved the apk to a bin folder I made. Hope that does not cause any issues when grading.



www.i-programmer.info was the site I used mostly to learn android studio. 
I used google for simple things like adding strings/colors to the xml files to avoid hard coding it.

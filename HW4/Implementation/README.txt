Most of this homework was very doable. The hardest part I had was storing the photos in the correct file

There is an sdcard and sdcard0 folder in my nexus7 tablet that I was testing
on that confused me for a bit but I eventually solved it.

I was getting null pointer exceptions pretty frequently but I found the issues was
that I was naming the directory/file wrong so the paths lead to nowhere.

I chose to turn it in late this week to focus on other assignments that were due
on friday.

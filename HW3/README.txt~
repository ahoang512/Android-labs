Anthony Hoang Homework 3
From the KLM analysis. The program I implemented myself took 41.45 seconds for 
the normal process of entering of a game. The apk that was given to us took 
51.23 seconds. Thus, the self implemented program has a faster user interface (given
 expert user) then the apk that used older UI widgets. 

 The implementation itself provided some struggles for me since figuring out how to organize
 the functions for the fragments took me a while. I was constantly googling why I was getting
 null pointer errors or why my program would crash as soon as I pressed done inside my fragments.
 Once I figured where to put methods that would be called from the fragment, the process became much simpler.
I did have to insert a assert main != null; in one of my functions inorder to make the program compile and
am still figuring out why I was getting a null pointer exception before that.

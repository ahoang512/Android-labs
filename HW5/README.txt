Anthony Hoang HW 5


The the multitouch gestures were much harder to implement then I imagined. Due to the amount
of midterms and projects that ended up being due this week I was not able to complete this homework
assignment. I was able to set the background and upload a picture from the gallery. I also managed to
successfully implement adding multiple markers to the map, but after attempting the multitouch, it
sort of broke. Anytime I used code I found code on time that I refered to I put the link to it in a
comment right next to the code. 

I had a lot of trouble figuring out what the MotionEvent constants represented which affected the way
my multi touch events were implemented.

At the current state circles can be placed on the picture and you can pan them around on top of the picture but not the picture itself.
